Problem
Rosalyn is a teacher who plays a review game with her class. The game involves writing each student's name on an identical slip of paper and selecting students at random. Here's the makeup of her class:
Grade	10th10th10, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript	11th11th11, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript	12th12th12, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript
Number of students	777	181818	555
Suppose that Rosalyn wants 222 different students, so she picks 222 names without replacing names between picks.
What is the probability that both students selected are 11th11th11, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript graders?
Round your answer to two decimal places.

Hint #11 / 4
Strategy
For some random process, we can find the probability that events AAstart text, A, end text and BBstart text, B, end text both occur using the general multiplication rule:
P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A)P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A)P, left parenthesis, start text, A, space, a, n, d, space, B, end text, right parenthesis, equals, P, left parenthesis, start text, A, end text, right parenthesis, dot, P, left parenthesis, start text, B, end text, vertical bar, start text, A, end text, right parenthesis
Note that P(B∣A)P(B∣A)P, left parenthesis, start text, B, end text, vertical bar, start text, A, end text, right parenthesis is the probability that BBstart text, B, end text occurs given that AAstart text, A, end text has already occurred.
Are the events independent?
If events AAstart text, A, end text and BBstart text, B, end text are independent, then one event occurring doesn't change the probability of the other event occurring. So if we know the events are independent, we know that P(B∣A)=P(B)P(B∣A)=P(B)P, left parenthesis, start text, B, end text, vertical bar, start text, A, end text, right parenthesis, equals, P, left parenthesis, start text, B, end text, right parenthesis, and we can rewrite the multiplication rule as:
P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B)P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B)P, left parenthesis, start text, A, space, a, n, d, space, B, end text, right parenthesis, equals, P, left parenthesis, start text, A, end text, right parenthesis, dot, P, left parenthesis, start text, B, end text, right parenthesis
Hint #22 / 4
Independent events?
We want the probability that neither of the students selected are 9th9th9, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript graders. Let's think of this one student at a time.
The class has 282828 total students, and 121212 of them are 9th9th9, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript graders, so 161616 of them are not 9th9th9, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript graders.
So the probability the first student picked is not a 9th9th9, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript grader is 16282816​start color #0c7f99, start fraction, 16, divided by, 28, end fraction, end color #0c7f99.
After picking the first name, Ana replaces it before picking another name. That means the names picked are independent.
So the probability the second student picked is not a 9th9th9, start superscript, start text, t, h, end text, end superscript grader is 16282816​start color #ca337c, start fraction, 16, divided by, 28, end fraction, end color #ca337c.

So the probability that Maya's first guess is correct is 2552​start color #0c7f99, start fraction, 2, divided by, 5, end fraction, end color #0c7f99.
Maya needs to guess a different answer for her next guess. That means the guesses are not independent.
